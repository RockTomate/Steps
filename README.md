Here you can find source code for RockTomate's steps (**not RockTomate plugin itself, which must be [purchased](http://u3d.as/1EfM)**)

## What is RockTomate?

RockTomate is an editor extension that allows you to automate repetitive tasks within the Unity engine. Tasks could be as simple as creating scenes or as complicated as building a project for multiple platforms with different configurations.

Feel free to visit [Unity Asset Store](http://u3d.as/1EfM) for more info.

## What is Step?

Step is a simplest instruction that RockTomate recognizes. It stores a logic and parameters which then get invoked during execution of a Job.

There are lots of steps for every occasion, but not for all occasions. Which is why you're free to create your own!
